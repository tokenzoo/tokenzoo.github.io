Welcome to the zoo!

The purpose of this website is organizing the vast universe of anonymous credentials.

## Zoo sections:

- [Implementations]({{site.baseurl}}/implementations.html): For anonymous credential schemes with concrete implementations
- [Research schemes]({{site.baseurl}}/schemes.html): For anonymous credential schemes with published papers
- [Primitives]({{site.baseurl}}/primitives.html): For the underlying cryptographic primitives that anonymous credential schemes can use
- [Properties]({{site.baseurl}}/properties.html): For the properties that various schemes have

## Research:

- [Bibliography]({{site.baseurl}}/bibliography.html): For the papers, articles, and other resources around anonymous credentials

## Engineering:

- Trust Token API
- Format
