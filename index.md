Welcome to the anonymous credentials zoo!

## What are anonymous credentials?

Anonymous credentials help anonymously authorizing users.

_A privacy-aware user wants to authenticate to a paid service, but without logging in.
Anonymous credentials can help authenticating that she's allowed to use a service without revealing any information about their identity, and make application-level tracking impossible._

There are two main types of anonymous credential systems:

- Tokens, which are lightweight, one-show anonymous credentials that encode a single message and can be used only once;
- Credentials, which are more structured, allow for embedding different attributes, and can be used multiple times.

## Website structure

In this website we attempt to organize the vast universe of anonymous credentials:

- We look into anonymous credential schemes that have been [published]({{site.baseurl}}/schemes.html) and peer-reviewed, as well as schemes with [concrete implementations]({{site.baseurl}}/implementations.html)
- We provide brief details on the mathematical [primitives]({{site.baseurl}}/primitives.html) that underlay these constructions
- We categorize the various [properties]({{site.baseurl}}/properties.html) that anonymous credential schemes can support
- We provide a [bibliography]({{site.baseurl}}/bibliography.html) enumerating papers, articles, and other resources around anonymous credentials
- We discuss the [engineering]({{site.baseurl}}/engineering.html) and deployment aspects of anonymous credentials [XXX trust token API, encodings, etc.]

## This is Work In Progress!
