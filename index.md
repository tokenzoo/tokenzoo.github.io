<center><blockquote> Alice wants to authenticate to a paid service.  Anonymous
credentials can help her authenticate and use the service without revealing any
information about her identity.  </blockquote></center>

<br>

Anonymous credentials provide identity and authentication while providing
strong privacy guarantees.

<br>

There are two main types of anonymous credential systems:<br><br>

- *Tokens*, which are lightweight anonymous credentials that encode a single message and can be used only once
- *Credentials*, which are more structured, allow for embedding different attributes, and can be used multiple times

## Website structure

In this website we attempt to organize the vast universe of anonymous credentials:<br><br>

- We present a variety of published anonymous credential [schemes]({{site.baseurl}}/schemes.html)
- We provide details on the mathematical [primitives]({{site.baseurl}}/primitives.html) that underlay these constructions
- We categorize the various [properties]({{site.baseurl}}/properties.html) that anonymous credential schemes can support

<!--
- We provide a [bibliography]({{site.baseurl}}/bibliography.html) enumerating papers, articles, and other resources around anonymous credentials
- We discuss the [engineering]({{site.baseurl}}/engineering.html) and deployment aspects of anonymous credentials [XXX trust token API, encodings, etc.]
-->
