There are two main types of anonymous credential systems:

- tokens
- credentials

Additionally, there are two possible configurations, allowing either public or
private verification. In both configurations, credentials are issued under a
secret server key. In publicly verifiable schemes, there is a public key that
allows verifying credentials/tokens. In privately verifiable schemes, only the
issuing server can verify.

Besides this, there are two main security properties that an anonymous credential
scheme should satisfy: unforgeability an unlinkability. Depending on the feature
of the particular scheme that is being chose, there are different additional
security properties.

## Unforgeability

Unforgeability refers to the notion that an adversary should not be able to
create credentials without the appropriate authorizations.

Studied over [Camenisch et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/580.pdf), and
also studies by studied [by Hoepman et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/842.pdf),
it can take quite a bit of different, specific definitions depending on the actual scheme.

In the case of tokens, we generally ask one-more-unforgeability, i.e. that it
is not possible to spend more tokens than have been issued. In the case of
credentials, we generally ask the adversary cannot authenticate for a
credentials that was not issued in the first place, even after observing
credentials of other users.

## Unlinkability

Unlinkability, also known as *blindness*, or *context-hiding* in other works,
indicated that the redemption of a credential (where the user is anonymous)
cannot be linked to its respective issuance (where the user is identified).

Studied [by Camenisch et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/580.pdf), in earliest
[works](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/179.pdf), and also [by Hoepman et al](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/842.pdf).
An anonymous credential scheme where linking the token to a user is protected
by information-theoretic means has perfect unlinkability, or *strong unlinkabiliy*.
Studied [by Akagi et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220797020_An_Efficient_Anonymous_Credential_System).
When talking about metadata (public or private) it assures that the tokens that
were issued with the same metadata are indistinguishable to the issuer when
redeemed.

## Additional Features

Most tokens introduce additional features, that help solving specific problems.

### Concurrent Security

A system is said to have concurrent security if the signer or issuer of tokens
or credentials can engage in multiple, concurrent issuances at the same time
without affecting security. Many schemes have proofs of sequential security,
wherein at most one issuance flow occurs at a time, yet fail to achieve concurrent
security. In practice, concurrent security is paramount.

### Single-Show and Multi-Show

Tokens or credentials may be either single- or multi-show, depending on the cryptographic
construction. For example, tokens derived from the output of an OPRF protocol are
typically single-show because spending the same token twice forces the client to
reveal the same input twice, thereby breaking unlinkability.

### Revocation

Defined here by [Acar et al.](https://www.iacr.org/archive/pkc2011/65710436/65710436.pdf) and
implemented using an accumulator scheme with delegatable non-membership proofs.
Revocation via blocklisting was also implemented by [Tsang et al.](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/pubs/akts07.pdf).

### Public Attributes

Anonymous credentials with "Public Attributes" can include metadata (e.g. provider, country of origin). The metadata is generated and signed by the issuer as part of the "credential
issuance" protocol, and are visible by the credential holder.

Certain schemes allow "selective disclosure" of attributes during token
redemption which allows the user to choose which attributes to reveal and which
ones to keep secret, while other schemes require disclosing all attributes.

### Private Attributes

Anonymous credentials with "Private Attributes" include metadata that is created
by and visible to the issuer but not by the credential holder. This can allow services
to "shadowban" or rate-limit flagged users.

Private attributes should hold privacy, in the sense that it is very difficult for
the issuer to link two credentials with the same set of private attributes.

### Delegatable

In a delegatable anonymous credential system, participants may use their
credentials anonymously as well as anonymously delegate them to other
participants.

Introduced in [CL06]({{site.baseurl}}/schemes.html#cl06).

### Escrow

TODO

### Threshold Issuance

A credential scheme where there can be multiple credential issuers which can
also potentially be Byzantine. (see [Coconut](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf)).
